# WISP Future Idea

Welcome to the WISP playbook! Here, you will find [tests](/Tests) and [plays](/Plays) to help navigate your unique situation.

## Usage
Read the plays that match your situation, or jump straight into tests that can help you secure your wireless network.

## Roadmap
This repository should ideally be continuously updated as new technology emerges, ensuring everyone stays up to date with methods to test various scenarios and defend against attackers.
